- Proper routing
- Proper authentication
- a `.bat` and `.sh` file for easier startings.
- finish create and edit functions for everything.
- instead using one api call to get all records from pocketbase, use one call for each element, 10000 items, 10000 calls, it will be inefficient but always latest data.
- add AppShell which can be disabled.
